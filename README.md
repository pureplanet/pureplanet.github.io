<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Due to the global energy crisis, record high wholesale energy costs, and the restrictions placed on us by the Ofgem Price Cap, we were unable to keep operating Pure Planet.</span></p>

You&rsquo;ve been wonderful. This wasn&rsquo;t part of the plan, and we&rsquo;re heartbroken it&rsquo;s had to end this way. </span></p>
